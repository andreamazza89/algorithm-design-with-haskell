I guess one way for the two to give the same result is if the binary operator
had the associative property (doesn't matter if grouping the operation to the left
or right).

If the above is true, I am not sure there are any requirements on `e`? So either there
is another solution, or I've missed something.

(looked at the solution) - it was that `e` needs to be the identity (e.g. 0 if the
operation is +). Somehow I don't believe it, so gonna try it out.
mmmm - using addition (+) it indeed isn't necessary for `e` to be 0...I wonder
what I'm missing.
