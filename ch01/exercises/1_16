First of all, I need to understand why it isn't valid over infinite lists.

the fusion law is

  h . foldr f e = foldr g (h e)

with the proviso (fusion condition) being that h (f x y) = g x (h y)

so, trying to reason about why it might not work over an infinite list, I guess I can
first imagine `h . foldr f e` working fine for an infinite list, but then under certain
conditions that does not work once fused.

mm I still don't have an intuition for how foldr does work over infinite lists, so I should
build that first - but I think I'm gonna be weak and peek at the solution.
